## About Me
Hello all! My name is Jessica Lopez, I am a first year MURP student in the Community Economic Developement and Housing (CEDH) concentration.
I was born and raised in Los Angeles (in Little Bangladesh) and moved around Los Angeles County. Other cities that became my home at some point include Compton, Boyle Heights, and South Gate. At the time I hated the moves but in retrospect I am grateful for the experience because it helped inform my career decisions and has influenced the changes I would like to contribute to in the communities that embraced me.
During my very limited spare time I love to cook and experiment with ingredients to make my healthy vegetarian alternatives to anything that I or my daughter may be craving. I also like to dedicate time to daily meditation :lotus_position_woman: and sitting in silence :massage_woman: before my seven year old daughter :girl: returns from school :face_exhaling:.

I love this beautiful meditation garden overlooking the ocean in Encinitas, CA. (:mosque: SRF Meditation Gardens :cactus:)

## Course Description
This GIS course will use Python to guide students to critically analyze, visualize, and describe spatial data to address current (and persistent) urban issues.
## Planning for Justice
My interests in the planning field are primarily focused on community economic development, which is pretty broad but I personally think that community economic development encompasses transportation, food, educational, housing and environmental justice in disinvested communities. I want justice for my communities - the communties that my little one will one day inherit.
## Project Ideas
I have many ideas. Among them is mapping disparities that exist for women and children of color in their lived environments. One project that I have had in mind for a long time is mapping the tree canopy disparties among schools throughout California. Particularly in juxtaposing disparities between low-income and wealthy communities. My interest is not only limited to tree canopy disparities but also access to healthy food options/grocery stores, parks and play spaces for children.
## Objectives for the Class
I am a novice in this field. I have zero experience and exposure to Python, coding or anything related to the subject. Although I do have some formal GIS instruction/specialization, it was limited to ArcGis Online. My objective for this course is to overcome my fear of Python and coding, and learn a new skillset that I can apply in my future career as a planner :cityscape:.
